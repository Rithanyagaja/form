# form
I developed a dynamic form builder web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, enabling users to create fully customizable forms with a title and date. Users can dynamically add different types of fields—including checkboxes, datetime pickers, and dropdown/select options—with full control over labels and input configurations.

Once a form is created, the application generates a unique shareable link, allowing others to easily access and fill out the form. On the backend, I used JavaScript (Node.js) to handle form submissions, storage, and retrieval. All form data, including structures and responses, are stored securely in a Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL) database.

Key features:

Dynamic form creation with live customization

Field types: text input, checkboxes, date/time picker, dropdowns

Shareable links for public form access

Backend logic using JavaScript for handling requests and responses

MS SQL integration for structured data storage and retrieval

This project reflects my ability to build full-stack web applications with a focus on user interactivity, data handling, and scalability.
